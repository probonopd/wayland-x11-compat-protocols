# wayland-x11-compat-protocols

The missing Wayland protocols for features that are available in X11 (but are denied by the official Wayland protocols).

## Protocols

Allow applications and desktop environments (and abstractions like [libxfce4windowing](https://gitlab.xfce.org/xfce/libxfce4windowing)) to do what they can do in X11...

- [x] Terminology: Handle _windows_ (not: "surfaces", "toplevels") like in X11 (_window_ ID, etc.) (for now we are assuming that `zwlr_foreign_toplevel_handle_v1` [for non-Wayland applications] and `xdg_toplevel` [for Wayland applications] is the Wayland equivalent of a window ID)
- [x] `screen_video_capture_v1`: Capture the screen (without Pipewire, Portals, etc. see [ext-screencopy-v1](https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/wayland/wayland-protocols/-/merge_requests/124); also check [ext-image-capture-source-v1](https://wayland.app/protocols/ext-image-capture-source-v1) and [ext-image-copy-capture-v1](https://wayland.app/protocols/ext-image-copy-capture-v1))
- [x] `global_shortcuts_v1`: Set global keyboard shortcuts (without Portals, etc.)
- [x] `window_properties_v1` Get the process ID and other vital information (like in `xprop`) and kill other applications (like `xkill`) (for partial support see [ext-foreign-toplevel-list](https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/wayland/wayland-protocols/-/merge_requests/187) and [ext-foreign-toplevel-state](https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/wayland/wayland-protocols/-/merge_requests/196))
- [x] `window_properties_v1`: Set key-value combinations on windows (atoms)
- [x] `window_management_v1`: Position windows in a [prescriptive](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=relxcJiHBnA&t=1230s) way (also see [ext-placement](https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/wayland/wayland-protocols/-/merge_requests/247)). Also see [river_layout_v3](https://codeberg.org/river/river/src/branch/master/protocol/river-layout-v3.xml) and [ext_placement_v1](https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/wayland/wayland-protocols/-/merge_requests/247). Looks like someone had figured all of this out with `wl_shell_surface_set_position` already in 2017 - only for it to be [dismissed](https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/wayland/wayland/-/blob/main/protocol/wayland.xml?ref_type=heads#L1092) in favor of the inferior `xdg_shell`. Maybe we can find _some_ compositors that _still_ support it nevertheless? And get Qt to support it (again)?
- [ ] Drag-and-drop between applications (There is `wl_data_offer`, but why can't we drag files from an archive manager to the file manager in Raspberry Pi OS then? We need a solution [without kludges like Portals and FUSE](https://gitlab.gnome.org/AlynxZhou/file-roller/-/commit/80f53ece6714c89f604a80d60a2153e7599060fd)) 
- [ ] Client data query (e.g., window/surface positions, cursor position with xhot/yhot position, keyboard state, window geometries; AT-SPI2 is very limited)
- [ ] An equivalent to XTEST (ability to send keystrokes, move the cursor, move/resize windows and so on; `ydotool` is somewhat limited)
- [ ] Frame callback-less rendering (ability to submit new frames at any time) (assuming it doesn't exist yet)
- [ ] (Feel free to suggest additional candidates)

...unencumbered, and without additional software besides the Wayland compositor (such as Pipewire, Portals, .desktop files, etc.).

Already being implemented upstream:

- [x] [`ext_toplevel_icon_v1`](https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/wayland/wayland-protocols/-/merge_requests/269) Set arbitrary window icons with no need for `.desktop` files (thanks [__ximion__](https://github.com/ximion); also see [The case for an icon protocol](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNSdIvdJeSw))

## Motivation

The official [wayland-protocols](https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/wayland/wayland-protocols) project has not provided protocols for essential functionality known from X11, hence preventing application developers and desktop environment developers from having a smooth transition path from X11 to Wayland with feature parity.

## What is this?

* This is a namespace for Wayland protocols (goverened outside of the existing Wayland projects)
* It is not expected that all Wayland compositors will implement these protocols, but most likely _some_ will
* Whenever people ask for something that works in X11 but not in Wayland, we add it there (ideally in a way that makes it trivially easy for people to port existing X11 applications to the x11-compat_... Wayland protocols)
* The only requirement for a protocol to be added to this namespace is: Functionality that works in X11 but does not work in Wayland due to Wayland policy decisions
* The protocols must not draw in additional dependencies besides the Wayland compositor itself (such as D-Bus, Pipewire, Portals, etc.)
* Parameters should ideally be the same as in the corresponding X11 API
* This is a volunteer-based community effort. Your contributions are highly welcome!
* `wayland-x11-compat-protocols` is a working title. Suggestions, anyone?

## But... security.

The windowing system is not the place to restrict what applications are and are not allowed to do.

If you want to restrict what applications can do, use a sandbox (or disallow these protocols in your compositor via a configuration setting).

## Also see

https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/wlroots/wlr-protocols/ - it seems to be addressing a few of the missing Wayland protocols. Unfortunately not all Wayland compositors are built on wlroots yet, so those may or may not work on your desktop.

in a search for a compromise between Wayland and applications that will
not be re-designed according to the Wayland principles and would remain
crippled. The basic idea there is to introduce "legacy compatibility
extensions" as a stop-gap measure and eventually stop using them for
those cases where both the application and the toolkits it uses are
still actively developed. It was met with justified criticism, and it
was not intended as a future proof solution for any application in the
first place.
